### Identifying the scale & scope

Contributing to any open-source project is a noble endevour however it should be
treated like any other professional project. First identify the scale and scope
of what you would like to contribute. If it is simple and/or small
(grammar/spelling or a bug fix) feel free to start straight away. If it is a new
feature or the proposed change is substantial then it's important to discuss with
the team and to begin breaking the problem down. Smaller tasks mean more people
can work on it and the quicker the piece is completed. It could also not be in
the direction of the project, we don't want you to waste your time! You might
also read these two blogs posts on contributing
code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette][etiquette] by Miguel de Icaza
and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests][push] by Ilya Grigorik. All code
submissions will be reviewed against the coding standards and tested/validated,
only those that meet the bar for both quality and appropriateness will be
merged into the source.

### Submitting a pull request

We loosely follow the [GitHub Flow][github-flow] process with our pull requests
with a few minor additions

1. Open a PR after your first commit - This ensures discussion can start early
and any concerns can be discussed early
2. Create a descriptive title and a detailed description. If possible reference
the issue that the PR resolves.
3. Commit often
4. When you feel you're complete, request a review
5. Work through any of the review comments
6. Merge once approved
7. Celebrate!

#### Tests

-  Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed.
-  100% test coverage must be maintained

#### Feedback

Your pull request will now go through extensive checks by the team. Please be
patient; we have full time jobs, but dedicate what spare time we can. Update
your pull request according to feedback until it is approved by one of the
team members.
